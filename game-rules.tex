  \item The game, called \emph{\gamename}, is played in the arena defined in
        Specification~\ref{spec:arena}. The objective is to collect 'apples' from
        a central location and return them to your scoring zone.
  \item There are 3 kinds of Apples, detailed below:
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item - Red Apples are easy to collect and score few points.
      \item - Golden Apples are harder to collect but score more points.
      \item - Rotten Apples carry negative points.            
  \end{enumerate}
  \item There will be 2 robots in each match.
  \item Each robot has a 'market stall' in their scoring zone which allows robots
        to score bonus points by placing their collected apples on it.
  \item The 'market stall' has 2 tiers as shown in ????????. Robots score
        more points for placing apples on the higher tier.
  \item The points awarded for putting each type of apple in each scoring zone is
        as follows:
