\section{Game Rules}
\label{sec:rules}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The game, called \emph{\gamename}, is played in the arena defined in
        Specification~\ref{spec:arena}. The objective is to 'capture territory' by 
        placing tokens around the arena.
  \item There will be up to 4 robots in each match.
  \item The arena contains 24 tokens, 6 belonging to each robot.
  \item There are 25 territories in the arena, arranged in a $5\times5$
        grid. The centre territory of the arena is raised.
  \item At the end of a match, tokens earn points as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Each territory is considered to be 'controlled' by whichever robot has \emph{the most}
            tokens of their colour in that territory.
      \item If a territory has equal numbers of tokens from two or more robots, that territory
            is considered to be controlled by none of the robots.
      \item Robots earn points for each territory they control, and controlling a number of adjoining
            territories earns bonus points.
      \item The number of points earned by controlling $n$ adjoining territories is $1+2+3+...+n$.
      \item The central (raised) territory is worth the same as \emph{two adjoining territories}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item A token is considered to be `in' a territory if the vertical projection of token
        is entirely within the scoring zone.
  \item A token is considered to be `on' the raised area if it is in contact with
        the top surface of the raised area.
  \item During a match, a robot may move or interact with any token in the arena.
  \item Participating teams must present their robots to match officials before
        the start of matches, as regulated by the match officials. Non-compliant
        teams may be disallowed from participating.
  \item \org may have any number of match officials within the arena, including
        during the course of matches.
  \item At the start of each match, robots must be entirely within their
        starting areas.
  \item At the start of each match, teams will be permitted to lean into the
        arena and start their robots.
  \item Each match lasts $120$ seconds.
  \item Teams may be disqualified from one or all matches by match officials,
        for non-compliance with regulations, lateness to the match, or any other
        reason at the discretion of the judge. Teams disqualified before the
        start time of a match will not be permitted to enter a robot.
\end{enumerate}
