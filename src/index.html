      <h2><a class="anchor" id="game-rules"></a>Game Rules</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The objective of the game, called <strong>Tin Can Rally</strong>, is to race around a track, avoiding tin cans along the way.
        <li>
          Before a match begins, participating teams must:
          <ul>
            <li>Present their robot in the staging area, adjacent to the arena, before the scheduled close of staging time. The staging area will be clearly marked on the day.
            <li>Attach a <a href="#flag-specification">robot flag</a>. Robot flags will be provided by SRO officials in the staging area.
            <li>Place their robot in the starting area that they are assigned. The robot must be placed such that it is entirely within this starting area, with no parts overhanging its boundary. Its orientation does not matter.
            <li>Vacate the arena before the scheduled start time. At this point there must be no interaction with the robot.
            <li>Follow the directions of the match officials.
          </ul>
          Teams that fail to comply with these rules – such as by arriving late – may forfeit the match, at the discretion of the judge.
        <li>
          The game is played between <strong>two</strong> robots.
        <li>
          Each match lasts for <strong>150</strong> seconds.
        <li>
          Robots will be started at the direction of match officials.
        <li>
          Game points will be awarded as follows:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <strong>1</strong> point is awarded each time a robot crosses a scoring line in the anti-clockwise direction.
            <li>
              At the end of each lap - defined as every subsequent forward crossing of the scoring line immediately in front of the robot's starting area - a robot is awarded an additional <strong>4</strong> points for the crossing.
            <li>
              A robot is deemed to have passed a scoring line when the whole robot passes the line.
            <li>
              If a robot passes backwards (i.e: clockwise) over any scoring line it must "undo" these before any further forwards line crossings will be counted.
          </ol>
        <li>
          At the end of the match the robot with the most points wins.
        <li>
          The arena is a square of the design specified in
          <a href="#specifications">the specifications section</a>.
      </ol>

    <section>
      <h2><a class="anchor" id="regulations"></a>Regulations</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          All robots must be safe.
        <li>
          The judge's decision is final.
        <li>
          Teams must conduct themselves within the principles of good sporting conduct.
        <li>
          Robots must be fully autonomous. No remote control systems or receivers are permitted.
        <li>
          Robots must pass a safety inspection before they can compete.
          <ol>
            <li>
              Robots must not have any sharp edges or points.
            <li>
              Robots must have all electronics securely mounted and easily removable.
            <li>
              Robots must provide adequate protection to the batteries they use, including
              using the provided battery box.
            <li>
              Robots must have a power switch, obvious and on top, which will completely immobilise
              the robot.
          </ol>
        <li>
          While accidental bumps and scrapes are inevitable, the sport is non-contact.
        <li>
          Robots must not intentionally damage anything inside the arena.
          At the discretion of the judge, teams who deliberately engage in collisions
          or take insufficient precautions against collisions may be penalised,
          including disqualification from rounds and deduction of league points.
        <li>
          Robots must have a spare USB slot accessible to match officials,
          so that a dongle can be connected to enable competition mode on the robot.
        <li>
          Robots must fit within a 500mm ⨉ 500mm ⨉ 500mm cube.
        <li>
          Robots must have a mass of less than 10kg.
        <li>
          Robots must not deliberately drop any part of themselves onto the arena.
        <li>
          Any assistance from Smallpeice Trust staff and volunteers is provided without guarantees.
        <li>
          Robots must have a <a href="#flag-specification">flag mounting</a>.
      </ol>
      <p>
        Violations of these regulations will result in penalties, including deductions
        of points or outright disqualification.

      <h3><a class="anchor" id="marker-specification"></a>Markers</h3>
      <p>
        The arena is labelled with fiducial markers. Each marker pattern encodes a number. Each marker number is associated with a particular feature within the arena, and also has an associated size.

        Sixteen arena wall markers are positioned around the arena as shown in the <a href="#arena-specification">arena specification</a>. Marker codes are mirrored on each side of the arena.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wall markers are placed such that the bottom of the marker is 20±5mm from the arena floor.

      <h3><a class="anchor" id="arena-specification"></a>Arena</h3>

          The above figure represents, to scale, a birds eye view of the arena. The arena is a square with side length <strong>5.4m</strong>.
        <li>
          The floor of the arena is covered with a closed-loop, short pile carpet.
        <li>
          The perimeter of the arena floor is delimited by the arena wall, which has a minimum height of 250mm.
        <li>
          The inner walls of the arena have a minimum height of 170mm.
        <li>
          Starting areas are 1000±50mm squares and will be marked by tape which is considered part of the starting area. Robots may start anywhere inside their starting area facing any direction.
        <li>
          SRO reserves the right to have match officials in the arena during games.

      <h3><a class="anchor" id="flag-specification"></a>Robot flags</h3>
      <img src="./fig-flag.svg" alt="Robot flag" width="40%" height="auto">
      <ol>
        <li>
          A "robot flag" is a removable identifier that will be attached to a robot throughout a match. It allows spectators to easily associate a robot with its starting area.
        <li>
          Flags are not counted when considering the size of the robot.
        <li>
          The identifying part of the robot flag must be visible when attached to the mount.
        <li>
          The mounting cylinder must be permanently affixed to the main chassis of a robot, and vertical when the robot is in its typical stopped position.
      </ol>
      <h3><a class="anchor" id="can-specification"></a>Cans</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cans are cylindrical metallic containers with a mass of 350±20g.
        <li>
          Cans are 67±3mm in diameter with a height of 100±5mm.
        <li>
          Cans will be arranged as shown in the <a href="#arena-specification">arena specification</a>.

      <h2><a class="anchor" id="comp-structure"></a>Competition Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The competition is structured in two phases:
          the <strong>main league</strong>
          and the <strong>knockout</strong>.
      </p>
      <h3><a class="anchor" id="matches"></a>Matches</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the end of a game, league points will be awarded as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>The team with the most game points will be awarded 4 points towards the competition league.
            <li>The team with the second most will be awarded 2.
            <li>Teams whose robot was not entered into the round, or who were disqualified from the round, will be awarded no points.
          </ul>
        <li>
          If a match ends in a tie, robots will be awarded the average of the points that their combined
          positions would be awarded, in this case 3 (since this is (4 + 2) &div; 2).
        <li>
          At the end of the leagues, positions in the leagues are used to seed a
          knockout. The knockouts will be used to determine the final 1<sup>st</sup>,
          2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> awards.
        <li>
          In the event of a tie in a knockout match, the team that ranked highest in the league will
          go through.
